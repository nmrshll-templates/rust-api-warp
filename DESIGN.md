# Cryptographically verifiable timestamps

This is an open problem and you can make necessary assumptions.

- Build a centralized timestamping service that allows users to post data and get cryptographic signatures from the service's private key. The service has a known public key.
- The service should be running over HTTP. You can use REST, JSON-RPC, etc.
- Any user can post data to the service to sign by bearing a "cost" directly proportional to the size of the data. You may consider PoW algorithms, one suggestion is Cuckoo (Rust implementation https://github.com/CodeChain-io/rust-cuckoo/).
- Any user can query the service's public key and verify the signature.
- It should not be possible to get more than 1 signature on the same data.
- The HTTP service should be non-blocking, i.e. it should be able to serve multiple requests in parallel.
- Unit tests should be added.

## Decisions

- Routes/methods:

  - get service's public key
    - no rate-limiting/PoW
  - sign data
    - rate-limited with PoW
    - data as base64-encoded bytes (since HTTP is text-only)
  - no need for a route to verify the signature:
    - this can be done on the client side
    - the user would need: the data, the server's signature, and to know which signature scheme was used
    - could build a client to automate that

- Errors:
  - Invalid PoW
  - Data already signed

The server needs persistence to keep track of the data already signed.
We use Postgres, and store the hashes of the data already signed.
